# Lab 9: Plane ol' Carriers

There are a lot of little classes to be written for today's lab, but many of them (and the methods within) are quite simple! See the posted lab for full instructions.

I haven't gotten any tests written for this lab yet, so just ensure that your classes can duplicate the functionality shown in the example at the end of the guide.
